FastAPI(Backend)
- Served on Ubuntu server.
- Ensure that appropriate CORS functionality is set up. Refer to fastapi CORS page for details.
- Ensure Java is installed on Ubuntu. Use Command: sudo apt install default-jre
    - User: tempadmin
    - IP: 172.19.10.67
    - Parent Directory:
        - /home/tempadmin/APP_pdf_to_csv
    -Backend Directory:
        - /home/tempadmin/APP_pdf_to_csv/app/backend
    - Command to run using uvicorn (ensure python venv is active by using cmd "source/venv/bin/activate")
        - uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 main:app
    - Gunicorn Deployment
        - gunicorn -w 1 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
        - At this time the api is functional, and can be reached using the url 172.19.10.67:8000/{some endpoint}
        - Make sure that port 8000 or whatever port being used by uvicorn is opened. This can be done using the commmands below.
            - netstat -na | grep :8000
            - ss -na | grep :8000
            - sudo ufw allow 8000

    - In order to create a servie to keep the app running, use systemctl and create a .service file.
        - Directory: /etc/systemd/system
        - Service file name: APP_pdf_to_csv.service.
        - Refer to file "APP_pdf_to_csv.service"
        - Since this app uses the tabula library which requires java, for a systemctl service ensure that the path for java is part of the .service file.
        - Start the service using: sudo systemctl start APP_pdf_to_csv.service
        - Enable the service to start on reboot: sudo systemctl enable APP_pdf_to_csv.service
    - Once the application is running, the following commands can be used:
        - Check status of service: systemctl status APP_pdf_to_csv
        - Check any errol logs associated with the servie: journalctl -u APP_pdf_to_csv.service

ReactAPP(Frontend)
- Served on same Ubuntu server as the backend.
- Install npm on server.
- Install nginx.
    - sudo apt install nginx
- Nginx configuration:
    - sudo mkdir /var/www/172.19.10.67   #this is where the code will be stored. So any changes that are made should be made in this directory.
    - sudo chmod 755 -R /var/www/172.19.10.67
    - sudo chown -R tempadmin:www-data /var/www/172.19.10.67
    - sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-availaible/172.19.10.67
        - The contents of this file should be as "front_end_nginx.txt".
    - Unlink the default and link the file that was created.
        - sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        - sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-availaible/172.19.10.67 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    - sudo nginx -t
    - sudo systemctl restart nginx
React Code:
    - npm run build
    - scp -r build/* tempadmin@172.19.10.67:var/www/172.19.10.67/
To access the app:
